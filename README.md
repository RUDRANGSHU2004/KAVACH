A PROJECT CREATED BY TECH MASTERS

Problem Statement:

PUBLIC SAFETY AND DEFENCE

Solution and approach:

A solution to public safety is to ensure that people start realising their responsibility to protect themselves ann their loved ones and our project focuses on protecting the people around the world.
STEPS to successfull completion
Step 1: Voice command activation(when given a pre set vword the whole system activates)
Step 2: Camera and voice recorder captures surroundings and audio
Step 3: Nrf module transmits the signal from the one transmitter to the reciever which starts the below steps
Step 4: Automatic GPS tracking and GSM alert(your location along with an sos is sent to your saved contacts and nearby police statio)
Step 5: Shock and pepper spray modules are deployed for self-defense

Features:

1. Personal Security: Provide an effective tool for women to enhance their safety in public and private spaces.


2. Real-Time Alerts: Send alerts to pre-configured emergency contacts when a distress signal is triggered.


3. Location Tracking: Provide GPS & GSM-based real-time location tracking for swift assistance.


4. Emergency Communication: Enable voice-activated or button-triggered emergency protocols.

5. Live Footage Capture: Embedded Camera for live footage recording.
      
6. Provides a means of Defense to the user: Wearable spark generator.



Tech Stack:

Voice Recognition Module,
 ESP32 Cam Module,
 Voice Recorder Module,
 GPS Ublox NEO 6m Module,
 SIM800L GPRS GSM Module,
 NRF24L01 2.4GHz Wireless Transceiver Module,
 Spark Generator Module

IDE used :- Arduino Ide
Coding Format :- C Language



Run Instructions:

A pre encoded activate command is present which can be used to activate the entire system, and it can be changed using voice prompts. The camera starts recording, the GPS module starts locking the satellites to gain location and the GSM module sends that location info through the SMS services to receiver's device. A SPARK GENERATOR and a PEPPER SPRAY is also built so that self defence can also be used.
