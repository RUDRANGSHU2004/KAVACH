Tech Stack:

Voice Recognition Module
ESP32 Cam Module
Voice Recorder Module
GPS Ublox NEO 6m Module
SIM800L GPRS GSM Module
NRF24L01 2.4GHz Wireless Transceiver Module
Spark Generator Module

IDE used :- Arduino Ide
Coding Format :- C Language



Run Instructions:

A pre encoded activate command is present which can be used to activate the entire system, and it can be changed using voice prompts. The camera starts recording, the GPS module starts locking the satellites to gain location and the GSM module sends that location info through the SMS services to receiver's device.
